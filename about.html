                    <h4>Director</h4>
                    <p>Roshini brings over 25 years of experience across banking and finance brokerage, with
                        more than
                        two decades spent in senior roles at a leading Australian bank. During her banking
                        career, she
                        held significant responsibility across credit assessment, relationship management, and
                        complex
                        lending structures, developing deep expertise across residential, commercial, and
                        business
                        finance.</p>
                    <p>In 2021, Roshini successfully founded Finro Finance Pty Ltd, establishing a growing and
                        highly
                        regarded brokerage delivering tailored finance solutions for residential and commercial
                        clients.
                        Building on this success and recognising increasing demand for specialist asset funding,
                        Roshini
                        expanded the business with the launch of Finro Asset Finance Pty Ltd – providing
                        dedicated
                        expertise to support businesses with structured equipment and asset finance solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>Highly professional and commercially astute, Roshini has a proven track record of
                        structuring
                        complex lending solutions on behalf of clients. Her strong relationships across a broad
                        lender
                        network provide greater flexibility, enhanced credit positioning, and access to a wider
                        range of
